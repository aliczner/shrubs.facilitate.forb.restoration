# shrubs.facilitate.forb.restoration

Restoring native species to invaded arid ecosystems is challenging as non-native species often limit native species establishment which limits success. Nurse plant facilitation may be utilized to improve native species establishment through reductions in abiotic and biotic stresses but this method has not yet been tested for native forb restoration in invaded arid ecosystems. Five native forb species were seeded in shrub and open microsites, with and without exclosures, and non-native removals to determine if shrubs can facilitate native forbs establishment in an invaded arid shrubland. Shrubs facilitated native species, and interestingly, most natives co-existed with non-natives, however, non-natives removals had a large positive effect for two less competitive native species. Exclosures overall were not effective at increasing natives. Seeding natives with shrubs and non-native removals are recommended as effective strategies for increase native species establishment in invaded arid systems.
